## Design & User Experience

### Designing Great User Experiences 

#### Basics of UX
Challenge statement

Validate the problem : Quite often we look at problems from our own point of view, which is dangerous as most of us in tech are actually power users and are in fact a minority of users. We are a vocal minority and can be fooled into thinking something is actually a problem when it isn’t.

Gathering Information:
1. Interal interview with stakeholders
2. Lightning talks 
3. User interviews
4. Ethnographic field research

Project Map: plot out the main steps for each user or player in a flow.

Wireframing & Storyboarding & Usability-test your designs

Create a prototype: Whatever tool you use make sure it is one that makes you focus on the flow and looks real. You need to test the prototype on real people so it needs to be as believable as possible but at the same time it shouldn’t take weeks of work to create.
